DFPS treats the "FHIR terminology layer" node above as a license-aware registry: `dfps_terminology::bridge::EnrichedCode` normalises system URLs, labels each code as licensed/open/OBO, and hands that metadata to `dfps_mapping`. CLI flows such as `map_codes` use `map_staging_codes_with_summary` to print counts by `CodeKind` so humans immediately see how many codes were missing identifiers or referenced licensed systems.
