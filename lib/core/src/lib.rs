//! Core domain model for DFPS (depth_forward_ontology_clinical_model).
//!
//! This crate will hold the functional domain model types (value objects,
//! entities, aggregates) with `serde` support.

/// Placeholder type so the crate is non-empty and compiles.
/// Replace this with real domain types as you build DM-02/DM-03.
