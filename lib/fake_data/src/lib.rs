//! Fake data generators for DFPS domain model.
//!
//! This crate will provide helpers to generate coherent fake data
//! for the types defined in `dfps_core`.

/// Simple placeholder function to prove the crate is wired correctly.
///
/// Later this will return real fake domain objects (patients, encounters, etc.).
