# Code of Conduct (Academic/Research Projects)

This project is a research‑oriented, open collaboration. We expect all contributors-students, faculty, staff, industry partners, and community members-to uphold professional, inclusive, and ethical behavior consistent with scholarly practice.

## Our Values

- **Scholarship:** Cite sources, attribute ideas, and respect intellectual property.
- **Integrity:** Do not fabricate, falsify, or selectively report results or benchmarks.
- **Inclusion & Respect:** Create a welcoming environment for people of all backgrounds and identities.
- **Stewardship:** Handle data, code, and infrastructure responsibly.
- **Openness:** Favor open discussion, clear documentation, and reproducible methods.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful in all interactions; critique ideas, not people.
- Use inclusive language. Assume good intent; clarify before concluding harm.
- Cite prior work and provide credit in README/docs when you adapt code, data, or designs.
- Protect privacy and confidentiality; do not share private or identifying information.
- Follow relevant policies and laws (e.g., IRB/HREC rules, HIPAA/GDPR where applicable).
- Strive for reproducibility: document environments, versions, and random seeds.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior of any kind.
- Doxxing, threats, stalking, or unwanted direct contact.
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome advances.
- Plagiarism or misappropriation of code, data, or ideas.
- Unauthorized access, misuse of credentials, or testing against systems you do not control.
- Sharing real‑world sensitive/regulated data (e.g., PHI/PII) in issues, PRs, or logs.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces (repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, meetings, conference workshops, and associated communication channels), both online and in person.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness a violation, or have concerns:

- Email: **<conduct@your‑lab.example.edu>** (replace with your contact)
- Optional alternate contact (e.g., Ombuds or department administrator): **<ombuds@your‑institution.edu>**
- In urgent safety situations, contact local authorities first.

We will respect requests for confidentiality to the extent possible and consistent with our obligations.

## Enforcement

- **Informal resolution:** Minor, first‑time issues may be resolved privately with clarification.
- **Warning:** Documented warning outlining the violation and expected changes.
- **Temporary or permanent restriction:** For repeated or severe violations (e.g., removal from org, banning from events).
- **Escalation:** When applicable, incidents may be referred to institutional offices per university policy.

Project maintainers must report conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from handling reports when appropriate.

## Attribution

This policy is inspired by widely used open‑source and academic conduct policies (e.g., Contributor Covenant) and adapted for research contexts.
